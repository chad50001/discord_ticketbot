# Contributing to Discord Ticket Bot

First off — thank you for taking the time to contribute! 🎫

This project is a **self-hosted Discord ticket bot** built with [Discord.js v14](https://discord.js.org)
and [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3). It is intentionally
lightweight: no external database, no telemetry, no build step. Please keep that
spirit in mind when proposing changes.

By participating in this project you agree to abide by our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Bugs

Before opening a bug report:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
2. Make sure you are on the **latest release** — check the
   [releases page](https://github.com/MSK-Scripts/discord_ticketbot/releases).
3. Confirm you are running **Node.js 22 or newer** (`node --version`).

A good bug report includes:

- Bot version (`package.json` → `version`) and Node.js version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Relevant console output (with `showLog` enabled in `config.jsonc`)
- **Never** paste your bot token, API keys, or other secrets

Use the [Bug Report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

---

## Requesting Features

Open a [Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and describe:

- The problem you are trying to solve (not just the proposed solution)
- How it fits a **self-hosted, dependency-light** bot
- Whether it should be configurable via `config.jsonc`

For larger features, please open an issue **before** writing code so we can agree
on the approach. This avoids wasted effort on changes that may not be merged.

---

## Reporting Security Issues

**Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.** Please follow the
process described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.

---

## Development Setup

### Requirements

- **Node.js** ≥ 22 (the project uses no transpiler — it runs directly via `node`)
- A Discord bot token — [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- A separate **test Discord server** you own (never test on production servers)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Fork & clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/discord_ticketbot.git
cd discord_ticketbot

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in TOKEN, CLIENT_ID, GUILD_ID (MSK_API_* is optional)

# 4. Run
npm start        # node index.js
npm run dev      # node --watch index.js (auto-restart on file changes)
```

On first start the bot copies `config/config.example.jsonc` → `config/config.jsonc`
and exits. Edit `config.jsonc` to match your test server, then start again.

> The bot works **fully without** `MSK_API_KEY`. Premium features (transcript
> hosting via the MSK API) degrade gracefully — transcripts are sent as `.html`
> file attachments instead of links. Please make sure your changes preserve this.

## Project Structure

A short orientation — see [`README.md`](README.md) for the full, always-current map.

```
index.js                ← entry point (dotenv + TicketClient.start())
src/
├── client.js           ← boot flow (banner, version/API check, config, login)
├── config.js           ← JSONC parser + validateConfig()
├── database.js         ← complete SQLite layer (tables, queries, inline migrations)
├── commands/           ← slash commands ({ data, execute })
├── components/         ← buttons / menus / modals (convention-based loader)
├── events/             ← interactionCreate, messageCreate, ready
├── handlers/           ← command/component/event loaders
└── utils/              ← embeds, logger, mskApi, snippets, ticketActions, transcript
locales/                ← de.json, en.json, main.json
config/                 ← *.example.jsonc templates + active (gitignored) configs
```

## Coding Conventions

This is **plain Node.js, CommonJS, no TypeScript**. Match the surrounding style.

- ✅ `require()` / `module.exports` — **no** `import` / `export`, no `.ts` / `.mjs`.
- ✅ Resolve paths with `path.resolve(__dirname, '../...')`, not bare relative strings.
- ✅ Buttons & selects always wrapped in `ActionRowBuilder` — never bare builder arrays.
- ✅ Ephemeral replies via `{ flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral }` (**not** the deprecated `ephemeral: true`).
- ✅ Non-critical Discord API calls use `.catch(() => null)`.
- ✅ Log through `client.logger.{info,warn,error,success,debug}` — `console.log` is
  reserved for the startup banner. Log strings are English, prefixed with the module,
  e.g. `client.logger.info('[AutoClose] Closed ticket #5')`.
- ✅ Component custom IDs start with **`tb_`**; dynamic args are appended with `:`
  (e.g. `tb_rate:{rating}:{ticketId}`).
- ✅ Permission checks go through `client.isStaff(member, ticketType?)`.
- ✅ Shared ticket lifecycle logic lives in `src/utils/ticketActions.js` — don't
  duplicate it inside command/button files.

**Please do not** add a build step, bundler, or TypeScript, and **do not add new
production dependencies** without discussing it first — the bot currently ships with
only three (`discord.js`, `better-sqlite3`, `dotenv`). Keeping it lean is a feature.

Avoid large, unprompted refactors (e.g. restructuring the locale system or DB layer)
without opening an issue first. Focused bug fixes and feature additions in the existing
style are always welcome.

---

## Internationalization (i18n)

User-facing strings must **never** be hardcoded — they go through
`client.t('path.to.key', { placeholder: 'value' })`.

When you add or change a user-facing string, update **all three** locale files at the
same key path:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `locales/main.json` | Master template (English) — source of truth for the structure |
| `locales/en.json` | English variant |
| `locales/de.json` | German translation |

Missing keys fall back to the raw path string (e.g. `messages.foo` shows up in the
UI), which makes gaps easy to spot. New translations for additional languages are
very welcome.

---

## Database Changes

The schema lives entirely in `src/database.js` and uses **inline migrations** — no
external migration tool.

- **New column:** add an existence check via
  `pragma('table_info(...)').map(c => c.name)` + `ALTER TABLE` inside `initDatabase()`.
- **New table:** add a `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` block inside `initDatabase()`.

This keeps existing users' `data/tickets.db` files upgradeable without manual steps.
Closed tickets are kept in the DB for statistics — the lifecycle ends at channel
rename + move, not deletion.

---

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

### Commits

- Write commit messages in **English**.
- Prefer [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) prefixes
  (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`) — this matches the existing
  history and feeds the auto-generated release notes (`.github/release.yml`).
- Keep commits focused; one logical change per commit where practical.

### Pull Requests

When you open a PR, GitHub automatically pre-fills the description from our
[Pull Request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) — please fill it in
completely rather than deleting it.

1. Branch off `main` (e.g. `feat/ticket-tags` or `fix/autoclose-flag`).
2. Make sure the bot **starts cleanly** (`npm start`) and your change works on a
   real test server.
3. Keep the relevant docs in sync — update `README.md` / `README_GER.md`,
   `config.example.jsonc`, and `CLAUDE.md` when you change behavior, config keys,
   commands, or the schema.
4. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry describing your change.
5. Open the PR against `main` with a clear description of **what** and **why**.
   Link any related issue.
6. Be responsive to review feedback — maintainers may request changes before merge.

There is no automated test suite; please manually verify the affected flows
(opening, claiming, closing, reopening, transcripts) and describe what you tested
in the PR.
