## Checklist

- [ ] My code follows the project's conventions (CommonJS, no TypeScript, `tb_` custom-id prefix, `client.logger`, etc.)
- [ ] No new production dependencies were added (or it was discussed in an issue first)
- [ ] User-facing strings go through `client.t(...)` and **all three** locale files (`main.json`, `en.json`, `de.json`) are in sync
- [ ] Any DB schema change uses an inline migration in `initDatabase()` (`ALTER TABLE` / `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`)
- [ ] The bot still works **without** `MSK_API_KEY` (premium features degrade gracefully)
- [ ] The bot starts cleanly (`npm start`) and I verified my change on a test server
- [ ] I updated the relevant docs (`README.md` / `README_GER.md`, `config.example.jsonc`, `CLAUDE.md`) where behavior, config keys, commands or the schema changed
- [ ] I added a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `[Unreleased]`
- [ ] My commit messages are in English and follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, …)
